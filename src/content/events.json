In her first 3 years of college she thought she would become a software engineer, specifically a frontend engineer as she enjoyed working on the UI. However, in the end of her 3rd year she found out about UX Design and Product Management, and started to explore these new field through volunteering at Develop for Good and Bridging Tech. She found her love in solving user problems rather than algorithm and efficiency problems, and so she switched to UX Design. In the past few years she has been especially interested in the connection between design and development and in ways to improve this link.",
